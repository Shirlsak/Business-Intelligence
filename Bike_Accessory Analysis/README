### **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

Bikes are increasingly becoming a preferred mode of transportation in recent times due to the increased cost of fuel and gas across the globe, most especially after the Covid-19 pandemic. 
With the rise in demand for the use of bikes, the cost of bikes and their accessories have also increased. Therefore analysing the sales of bikes and their accessories will be beneficial 
to companies in the bike market and also to manufacturers of these products. This will help determine the factors that will help boost the revenue and profit of their business and also 
help them make informed decisions in the future to ensure the growth of the business across the United States and Europe.
The aim of the project was to perform various analyses on the bikes and accessory sales in United States and Europe and determine the factors that boosted the market.
The analysis was based on various categories in relation to the data set such as geography, customer, product and annual sales. 
It also helped in the estimating of future revenue based on past performance and trends from the dataset for businesses so as to help them make decisions effectively .
