With the rise in demand for the use of bikes, the cost of bikes and their accessories have also increased. Therefore analysing the sales of bikes and their accessories will be beneficial 
to companies in the bike market and also to manufacturers of these products. This will help determine the factors that will help boost the revenue and profit of their business and also 
help them make informed decisions in the future to ensure the growth of the business across the United States and Europe.
